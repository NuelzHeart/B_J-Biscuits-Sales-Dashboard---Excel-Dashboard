## Recommnendations
- Expand and Promote High-Performing Products: Increase production, visibility, and marketing for Shortbread, Vanilla Waffles, and Ginger Snaps to maximize profit from already proven products.
- Replicate San Antonio’s Success in Other Regions: Study the factors behind San Antonio’s strong performance and apply those strategies—pricing, staffing, promotions- to other regions.
- Implement Premium Loyalty Programs for High-Value Customers: Create VIP rewards, exclusive discounts, or early-access offers to retain and further engage customers like Robert Hernandez.
- Intensify Marketing and Product Positioning Toward Male Age 31–70 Segment: Develop tailored campaigns, bundles, and communication strategies targeting the demographic that contributes the most revenue.
- Enhance Digital Payment Experience & Offer Payment-Based Incentives: Since all payment channels perform equally, promote digital payments with small incentives to increase checkout efficiency and reduce cash-handling risks.
- Strengthen Sales Team Performance Through Mentoring and Training: Use top performers like Travis Doyle as benchmarks to train lower-performing reps, improving overall team output.
- Introduce Seasonal Boost Strategies to Address Aug–Dec Sales Decline: Run promotions, product bundles, holiday campaigns, or special offers during low-performing months to stabilize year-end revenue.
